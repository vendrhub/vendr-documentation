## Vendr.Web.PropertyEditors.Stock namespace

| Public Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| class [StockComponent](stockcomponent/) | Component to hook into the content saved event handler in order to update stock values. We have to do it this way because we need to ensure a content item has been saved and has a key before we can persist the stock as we need the key as reference. Without this, you'd have to disallow entry during create which isn't an ideal UX. With this approach, we can allow a stock level to be entered straight away and only persist it when the content item itself has been persisted. |
| class [StockComposer](stockcomposer/) |  |

## Vendr.Web.PropertyEditors.VariantsEditor namespace

| Public Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| class [VariantsEditorComponent](variantseditorcomponent/) | Component to watch for content changes to nodes with a variants editor on them and stash a storeId property in the data structure. This is predominantly for Vendr Deploy which needs to lookup Product Attribute dependencies but needs as storeId to do it however the Umbraco Deploy value connectors don't have any other context other than the property value and it's property type. This may also be true for uSycn too. We could also look to potentially use this in the value converter for the variants editor as we now have this also being store aware. |
| class [VariantsEditorComposer](variantseditorcomposer/) |  |
| class [VariantsEditorConfiguration](variantseditorconfiguration/) |  |
| class [VariantsEditorDataConverter](variantseditordataconverter/) |  |
| class [VariantsEditorPropertyEditor](variantseditorpropertyeditor/) |  |
