title: Order Editor Config
description: Customizing the Order Editor interface in Vendr, the eCommerce solution for Umbraco v8+
---

With Vendr, there are minimal rules about what information you are required to record about an Order, however, this does pose a problem for how we provide a User Interface for managing Orders when we don't know exactly what properties you are going to be recording.

In order to allow this flexibility whilst still providing an ability to view and manage Orders in the back-office, Vendr's Order Editor interface make use a configuration file to map [Order/Order Line Properties](../properties/) to it's various UI elements.

With this configuration file, you can completely customize the Order Editor interface to suit your particular needs.

## Example Order Editor Config File

And example of an Order Editor config file would look something like this:

````javascript
{
    orderLine: {
        properties: [
            { alias: "color", label: "Color", isReadOnly: true, showInOrderLineSummary: true },
            { alias: "size", label: "Size", isReadOnly: true }
        ]
    },
    customer: {
        // Firstname, Lastname and Email are already known
        company: { alias: "company", label: "Company Name" },
        taxCode: { alias: "taxCode", label: "Tax Code" },
        telephone: { alias: "telephone", label: "Telephone" },
    },
    billing: {
        addressLine1: { alias: "billingAddressLine1", label: "Street Address Line 1" },
        addressLine2: { alias: "billingAddressLine2", label: "Street Address Line 2" },
        city: { alias: "billingCity", label: "City" },
        zipCode: { alias: "billingZipCode", label: "Zip Code" },
        telephone: { alias: "billingTelephone", label: "Telephone" },
        // Country and Region are already known
    },
    shipping: {
        enabled: true,
        sameAsBilling: { alias: "shippingSameAsBilling", label: "Same as billing", trueValue: "1", falseValue: "0" },
        firstName: { alias: "shippingFirstName", label: "First Name" },
        lastName: { alias: "shippingLastName", label: "Last Name" },
        addressLine1: { alias: "shippingAddressLine1", label: "Street Address Line 1" },
        addressLine2: { alias: "shippingAddressLine2", label: "Street Address Line 2" },
        city: { alias: "shippingCity", label: "City" },
        zipCode: { alias: "shippingZipCode", label: "Zip Code" },
        telephone: { alias: "shippingTelephone", label: "Telephone" },
        // Country and Region are already known
    },
    notes: {
        customerNotes: { alias: "comments", label: "Customer Comments" },
        internalNotes: { alias: "notes", label: "Internal Notes" }
    },
    additionalInfo: [
        ipAddress: { alias: "ipAddress", label: "IP Address", isReadOnly: true }
    ]
}
````

The Order Editor config file is broken up into a series of sections, each of which relate to a particular section of the Order Editor User Interface.

### Order Line Config Options

The Order Line config block configures which Order Line properties should be viewable and/or manageable within the Order Editor UI. For each Order Line Property you can provide the following options:

| `label` | A friendly label to display for this property in the editor interface |

![Additional Info Editor](~/assets/images/screenshots/order_editor_config_store_setting.png)

## Custom Order Editor View

If you wish to entirely replace the Order Editor view with a custom implementation you can create an Order Editor Config file with a single `view` config option which points the path of an alternative AngularJS view file to use for editing the Order.

````javascript
{
    view: '/app_plugins/myplugin/views/ordereditor/ordereditor.html'
}
````
