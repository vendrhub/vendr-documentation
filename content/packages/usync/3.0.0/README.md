## About Vendr uSync

[Vendr uSync](https://vendr.net/add-ons/vendr-usync/) is a free and open source add-on package for Vendr, providing uSync import / export support, allowing the easy transfer of Vendr settings between environments.

## Using These Docs

**These docs are aimed at developers and users** who have at least a basic understanding of  [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com), as well as Umbraco back-office principles.

As there is no code involved with using Vendr uSync, the docs are purely a series of [Getting Started](getting-started/) steps to get Vendr uSync installed and configured.

## Getting Help

If you require further assistance, or if you are having a particular issue you can't find an answer to, you can get community support via our support forum over on the [Umbraco developer portal](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/website-utilities/vendr/vendr-support/).

## About Vendr

Vendr is the eCommerce solution for Umbraco v8+ created by Outfield Digital, the team behind Tea Commerce for Umbraco v7. Vendr is the successor to Tea Commerce and follows much of the same principles but has been vastly improved for use on Umbraco v8+.
