In this section we will guide you through the key steps necessary to get you started with the Vendr uSync package for Vendr.

It is assumed that before we begin that you already have an Umbraco v8+ website configured with uSync, along with Vendr 1.3+ installed and a store set up. If you are not at this stage yet, please read the [core Vendr documentation](../../../../../core/) to learn how to get started with Vendr and return to this section once you have these requirements in place.
