There are currently two ways to install the Checkout.com payment provider for Vendr into your solution. Using the Umbraco package distribution, installed via the Umbraco back-office, or using our NuGet packages, installed directly into your projects code base via the NuGet Package Manager. Where possible, it is our recommendation to use the NuGet packages as these allow a great level of ease/control when upgrading later on.

## Umbraco Package Installation

To install the Checkout.com payment provider Umbraco package, you will need to download the package file manually from the Vendr package page on the [Umbraco Developer Portal](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/website-utilities/vendr/). On this page, scroll down to the **Package Files** section and locate the Checkout.com payment provider package, clicking it to initiate a download.

Once downloaded you should manually install the package by uploading it to the **local package installer** located in your back-office **Packages > Install Local** section. Once uploaded, follow the on-screen instructions provided to complete the install.

## NuGet Package Installation

To install the Checkout.com payment provider via NuGet you can run the following command directly in the NuGet Manager Console window:

```bash
PM> Install-Package Vendr.PaymentProviders.CheckoutDotCom
```

Alternatively, you can also find and install the NuGet package via the NuGet Package Manager GUI.

## Upgrading

<message-box type="warn" heading="Before you upgrade">

Before upgrading, it is always advisable to take a complete backup of your site/database. Every effort has been made to ensure that Vendr will upgrade gracefully, but there is always a risk that something may not install as expected.

</message-box>

Vendr uses Umbraco Migrations to install all of it's features meaning upgrades follow the exact same process as the installation processes detailed above, installing the latest version of a package over the top of the existing package installation. Vendr is then clever enough to detect the current state of your site and only install the features that are missing.
